PDF résumé from HTML 
====================

### This code lets your write your résumé in HTML + CSS and then compiles it to PDF

### Why?

I don't own a licensed copy of Microsoft Word. I don't want to buy a copy just for creating a résumé. 
Google Docs and Libre Office is not powerful enough for extreme formatting. I gave LaTeX a shot, but it appears
to be a wrong tool to choose for something like a résumé. So here I go. I'm using HTML+CSS for resume.

## How to start developing?

- How I develop is I run `make watch-build` which will start compiling PDF from HTML every 2 seconds.
- I then open the generated PDF in the browser and keep on hitting whenever I want it updated
- I change the HTML/CSS code in the repository and go back to the browser and hit refresh
