    </div>
    <p class="description">Worked as a data engineer on processing and transforming data. Worked on improving the legacy data pipelines that
      were written. Working on business critical, sensitive and financial data. The total data migration affects over
      80000 live users. Doing this with two other 3rd party teams working with banking/financial domain. The data
      transformations written for these projects were done in DBT with proper unit tested code.</p>
    <p class="description">Improved the existing practices that led to improvement of the delivery speed. Helped the Data Engineers up their
      skill from plain simple DBA role to move towards automation. This led them to start using scripts instead of doing
      things manually further causing an increase in their efficiency.</p>
    <p class="description">The technologies used in these projects include, SQL, DBT, Snowflake, Terraform, Gitlab-CI, Python, Airflow.</p>

      parts of the paper</p>
    <p class="description">Successfully used Netflix’s Metaflow tool, to create experiments for Data Scientists; along with building ETL
      pipelines for the deployment of ML models; leading to improvements in the Data Scientists’ workflow in training
      models</p>
    <p class="description">Led sessions in Pandas explaining low-performance vs high-performance code used in ML models; enabling the data
      scientists and engineers improve the performance of the existing ML models</p>
    <p class="description">Responsible for ML performance tests, comparing the model’s capability with an old model; displaying improvement
      in predictions from 82% to 90% and an increased success rate of submissions from 92% to 98%</p>
