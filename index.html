    <p class="description">A passionate software engineer with a strong attachment to technology from a young age. I prefer taking a
    pragmatic approach towards software development despite having strong opinions towards different
    technologies and concepts. My experience ranges from backend web development, to building CI-CD and infra up to writing
    frontend react applications. In addition to my professional work I spend my free time indulging in other software
    engineering and tech related things.</p>

    <div class="subsection-org-location">
      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Data Engineer</h4>
      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Working remote</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="description">Worked as a data engineer on processing and transforming data. Worked on improving the legacy data pipelines that
      were written. Working on business critical, sensitive and financial data. The total data migration affects roughly
      100000 live users. Doing this with two other 3rd party system working with banking/financial domain. The data
      transformations written for these projects were done in DBT with proper unit tested code.</p>
    <p class="description">Improved the existing practices that led to improvement of the delivery speed. Helped the Data Engineers upgrade their
      skill from plain simple DBA role to move towards programming and automation. This led them to start using scripts and other tools instead of manually performing activities further increasing their efficiency.</p>
    <p class="description">The technologies used in these projects include, SQL, DBT, Snowflake, Terraform, Gitlab-CI, Python, Airflow.</p>

    <div class="subsection-org-location">
      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Software/ML Ops Engineer</h4>
      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Oxford, United Kingdom</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="description">Worked on a human in the loop project with Elsevier (Research Data Platform) where I was a pivotal part of the
      team that created and enabled the HiLoop software, providing feedback to an ML system, based on confidence values;
      by integrating it into the prediction feedback loop. This enabled the Data Scientist teams to identify issues with
      bad predictions, enabling fine-tuning of the ML model.</p>
    <p class="description">Did dev-ops work using technologies like Terraform and Kubernetes
      to set up microservices and micro-frontends; enabling the existing teams to split into smaller teams, whilst
      maximising output</p>
    <p class="description">Worked with Data Scientists at Elsevier Research Data Platform on an ML Ops project. The key focus of the project
      was to run thousands of research papers on the cloud through ML models to extract patterns from the papers</p>
    <p class="description">Successfully used Netflix’s Metaflow tool, to create experiments for Data Scientists; along with building ETL
      pipelines for the deployment of ML models; leading to improvements in the Data Scientists’ workflow in training
      models</p>
    <p class="description">Led sessions in Pandas explaining low-performance vs high-performance code used in ML models; enabling the data
      scientists and engineers improve the performance of the existing ML models</p>
    <p class="description">Led creation of suite for ML performance tests, comparing the model’s capability with an old model; displaying improvement
      in predictions from 82% to 90% and an increased success rate of submissions from 92% to 98%. This not only helped in seeing the performance
      improvement but also the methodology of writing good/clean readable code helped the BAU teams maintain the project really well.</p>

      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Software Engineer</h4>
      <h4 class="work-subtitle">Pune, India</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="description">Worked on a full-stack project for a cellular business domain. The project had over 16 million live users. Worked
      on an on-call support of production issues; reporting these issues and in some cases debugging them in case of critical production issues.
      In addition to writing software code, we had to insert monitoring points in the code which would track succeeding and failing endpoints on
      Grafana monitoring dashboard and in case of an incident would send us an alert to our phones via PagerDuty. Helped with inculcating good
      practices around writing unit tests for the frontend heavy code with mock servers which further helped the team in the future making it
      easy and quick for them to add new features or to fix existing bugs.
      The technologies I used in this project include Java Spring for the backend and React in Typescript for the frontend.</p>

    <p class="description">Consulted for a pretty massive project them with code quality practices, and other practices to increase the
      efficiency of development. Introduced the team to practices like Clean Code, Test-Driven development and
      automation of all the tools using Makefile. Helped the team there to add tools that would incrementally make them add new tests
      and the linters that would point at ugly code. Worked to improve the CI/CD by displaying them how beneficial it would be for them
      to move away from a manual testing and deployment process to an automated one.</p>

    <p class="description">Used technologies including Docker, Laravel/Lumen on the backend, React, and Backbone on the frontend
      making applications for solving logistics and supply chain problems for an e-commerce company. This included but not limited to
      tracking goods arriving at different warehouses in the supply chains, tracking where the items get lost. Generating QR codes for
      items to make it easy for the on-warehouse employees to do a quick scan and make an entry in the system instantly.
      In addition to developing software, was also involved in facilitating coderetreats in colleges and helping students learn
      the clean coding practices.</p>

      The software consists of entire supply chain of supplying fuel right from the depots to the kiosk
      using an automated authentication mechanism to prevent theft. All of which was monitored at real time via cloud. I was responsible
      in the development of the entire vertical slices right from the database to backend, API, frontend (both the browser and other
      clients like mobile, kiosk and driver app).</p>
    <p class="description">Wrote schedulers and mechanism to shut down and wakeup the Kiosk screen to save power as set by the admins managing from
      the dashboard. Created audit trail for the activities performed by the admins and were monitored by the super admins from their dashboard.
      Added quick unit tests and improved the existing tests to increase the speed of the overall code to help much faster development and deployment.
      This increase in the speed led to increase in the development speed letting us deploy entire vertical slices within a day or less.</p>
