    <p>A passionate software engineer with a strong attachment to technology from a young age. I prefer taking a
    pragmatic approach towards software development despite my strong opinions towards different
    technologies/concepts. My experience ranges from backend web development, to building CI-CD and infra up to writing
    frontend react applications. In addition to my professional work I spend my free time indulging in other software
    engineering related things.</p>

      <h4 class="subsection-org-location">Data Engineer &hyphen; Remote work</h4>
    </div>
    <span class="time-period">Nov 2021 &hyphen; </span>
    <p>Worked as a data engineer on processing and transforming data. Worked on improving the legacy data pipelines that
      were written. Working on business critical, sensitive and financial data. The total data migration affects over
      80000 live users. Doing this with two other 3rd party teams working with banking/financial domain. The data
      transformations written for these projects were done in DBT with proper unit tested code.</p>
    <p>Improved the existing practices that led to improvement of the delivery speed. Helped the Data Engineers up their
      skill from plain simple DBA role to move towards automation. This led them to start using scripts instead of doing
      things manually further causing an increase in their efficiency.</p>
    <p>The technologies used in these projects include, SQL, DBT, Snowflake, Terraform, Gitlab-CI, Python, Airflow.</p>

    <p>Worked on a human in the loop project with Elsevier (Research Data Platform) where I was a pivotal part of the
      team that created and enabled the HiLoop software, providing feedback to an ML system, based on confidence values;
      by integrating it into the prediction feedback loop. This enabled the Data Scientist teams to identify issues with
      bad predictions, enabling fine-tuning of the ML model.</p>
    <p>Worked as a part of a multidisciplinary team as a software engineer on technologies like Terraform and Kubernetes
      to set up microservices and micro-frontends; enabling the existing teams to split into smaller teams, whilst
      maximising output</p>
    <p>Worked with Data Scientists at Elsevier Research Data Platform on a project involving a lot of ML Ops work</p>
    <p>The key focus of the project was to run thousands of research papers on the cloud through ML models to extract
      parts of the paper</p>
    <p>Successfully used Netflix’s Metaflow tool, to create experiments for Data Scientists; along with building ETL
      pipelines for the deployment of ML models; leading to improvements in the Data Scientists’ workflow in training
      models</p>
    <p>Led sessions in Pandas explaining low-performance vs high-performance code used in ML models; enabling the data
      scientists and engineers improve the performance of the existing ML models</p>
    <p>Responsible for ML performance tests, comparing the model’s capability with an old model; displaying improvement
      in predictions from 82\% to 90\% and an increased success rate of submissions from 92% to 98%</p>
